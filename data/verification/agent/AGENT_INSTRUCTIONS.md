# Etymology verification task — instructions

You are verifying the etymological derivations from Ali Nourai's *An Etymological
Dictionary of Persian, English and other Indo-European Languages* (1999), which this
repository (`/home/sfmqrb/git/rishe`) turned into JSON (`data/extracted/batch/page-<pdf>.json`).
Compact text renderings of the charts are in
`/home/sfmqrb/git/rishe/data/verification/agent/charts/page-<pdf>.txt`.

Each chart is a tree: a ROOT box, then nodes `#id (parent #p) [Language] refs=… | word «script» : gloss`.
An arrow parent→child in the book means "child derives from parent". `parent #0` = derives from the root.
Redirect entries (`ROOT X -> redirect to Y`) need no verification: skip them (do not include them).

## Your job, per chart (entry)

1. Verify the ROOT itself: is the reconstructed root real, is the language label right,
   is the gloss right? (e.g. PIE *dʰeyǵʰ- "knead, form" — Pokorny 244.)
2. Verify EVERY node (every derivation edge parent→child, and every word in the node):
   - Is the word real, in that language, with that meaning?
   - Does it really descend from (or was borrowed from) the parent as drawn?
   - Give the **derivation explanation**: how, phonetically and historically, the child form
     arises from the parent form. Be concrete: name the sound changes (e.g. "Av. pairi-daēza-
     → MP *pardēz; Greek borrowed it in the 5th c. BCE as paradeisos (Xenophon), Greek
     -ei- rendering Iranian -ē-; Latin paradīsus; Old French paradis; Middle English
     paradis > paradise"), the route of borrowing (which people/era/text), and the
     semantic shift ("walled enclosure" → "royal park" → "Garden of Eden" via the Septuagint).
     For Persian words descend through Old Iranian → Middle Persian → New Persian and name
     the intermediate forms when sources give them (e.g. OP didā- / Av. daēza- → MP diz →
     NP dež/dez). For Arabic loans note the Arabic stem, and for Arabic-mediated round-trips
     (Persian → Arabic → Persian) say so.
3. Give a verdict per node and per root:
   - `confirmed` — independent modern sources agree with the chart (same root, same route).
   - `plausible` — sources give a compatible but not identical picture, or the derivation
     is accepted by some scholars but not all; explain the difference.
   - `disputed` — modern scholarship (Wiktionary with citations, Etymonline, AHD, Cheung,
     Hasandust, Beekes, de Vaan, Kroonen, MacKenzie…) prefers a DIFFERENT origin, or the
     word is unrelated. Explain what the modern view is.
   - `unverified` — you could not find any independent source either way (say what you tried).
   - `transcription_suspect` — the form in the JSON is not what the sources know (a misread
     letter, an impossible form, a wrong Persian script). See "Transcription flags" below:
     you must check the printed page and say whether the book or the extraction is at fault.
4. Record sources as URLs (Wiktionary page, Etymonline page, AHD appendix entry, archive.org
   page of Klein/Horn/Bartholomae, etc.). Also note when Nourai's own cited reference
   (KLN, POK, AHD, BQT, MON, HRN, HUB…) is itself the modern standard for that claim.

## Checking Nourai's OWN cited references (required)

Every node carries `refs=` — Nourai's citations, e.g. `KLN:164; FVQ:75` (abbreviation:page;
`MON5:528` = MON vol. 5 p. 528). The author claims each arrow is supported by those pages.
You must check them:

- The bibliography key (abbreviation → book), where each reference can be read, page
  offsets and lookup hints: `/home/sfmqrb/git/rishe/data/verification/sources/refs_online.json`
  (keys = abbreviations; `kind`, `url`, `lookup_hint`, `local_file`, `page_offset`, `scans`, `cites`).
- If `local_file` is set, the OCR text of that book is on disk under
  `/home/sfmqrb/git/rishe/data/verification/sources/refs/`: grep it for the headword (try
  several spellings — OCR of diacritics is noisy; e.g. `grep -n -i 'barak' …`) and, if a page
  offset is given, locate the cited page (pages are separated by form-feeds; `_pages.txt`
  files also carry `[pdf page N]` tags; use `awk 'BEGIN{RS="\f"} NR==<n>' file` to print one
  page). Read the entry and judge whether it actually says what Nourai's arrow says.
- **Scanned references without full OCR text** (Borhan-e Qate' vols 3–5 = BQT pages
  ~1208–2475, Farahvashi's Iranvij = IRN, Aryanpur = ARY, any entry with a `scans` list): do
  NOT OCR whole books. Fetch only the cited page:
  `python3 /home/sfmqrb/git/rishe/tools/ref_page.py BQT:918 --image`
  It renders that one page to PNG, OCRs it (Persian OCR is rough), caches both under
  `data/verification/sources/refs/ocr/`, and prints the text plus the PNG path. If the OCR
  is unreadable, Read the PNG (you can read Persian print directly), and then SAVE what you
  read: write the entry/entries you used (headword, Mo'in's etymological footnote, and any
  surrounding lines you relied on) verbatim to the companion file
  `data/verification/sources/refs/ocr/<ABBR>/<page>.vision.txt` (the tool prints the exact
  paths). The tool prefers that file next time, so nobody pays for reading the image again.
  If the printed page number on the image is off, re-run with `--pdf-page <n>` adjusted, and
  note the correct pdf page in your ref_check note. Borhan vol. 5 (the addenda, own
  pagination 1–290) is reached only as `BQT5:<page>`; Borhan vols 1–2 exist as OCR text
  files (`BQT_v1_pages.txt`, `BQT_v2_pages.txt`), vols 3–5 as `BQT_v3/4/5_pages.txt` too.
- If `kind` is `website`, use the `lookup_hint` URL pattern with WebFetch (e.g. Mo'in via
  vajehyab.com / abadis.ir).
- Do this for at least ONE cited reference per node (the most authoritative available:
  POK/AHD/KLN for IE roots, HRN/HUB/BRT/KNT/PHD for Iranian, KLN/FVQ/AFM/PLA for Semitic,
  BQT/MON for Persian). If none of a node's references is accessible, say so.

Add to every node a `ref_check` array:

```json
"ref_check": [
  {"ref": "KLN:164", "status": "supports", "note": "Klein p.164 s.v. 'cherub': Heb. kerūbh, prob. rel. to Akkad. karābu 'to bless', metathesis of b-r-k — exactly Nourai's claim."},
  {"ref": "FVQ:75", "status": "not_checked", "note": "no online copy"}
]
```

`status` ∈ `supports` (the page says what the arrow says) · `partial` (the reference has the
word but a different/looser derivation) · `contradicts` (the reference says something else)
· `not_found` (checked the text, could not find the entry/page) · `not_checked` (reference
not accessible online). Quote the key phrase of the reference in `note` when you can, with
the file/leaf/page where you found it.

Also add to each entry a root-level `ref_check` for the root's own refs (e.g. `POK:244`).

## Use EVERY relevant book on disk (required)

Checking only the reference Nourai cites is not enough. For every node, also consult the
other books in the local library that could speak to that claim, and record what each says.
The list of which books cover which kind of node, with file paths, is
`/home/sfmqrb/git/rishe/data/verification/sources/SOURCE_MATRIX.md`. Minimum per node:

- an Indo-European node or root box: Pokorny (POK) AND Walde-Pokorny (WLD) AND Watkins/AHD,
  plus Mann (IEC) or Buck (SYN) when the word is a common noun;
- an Avestan / Old Persian node: Bartholomae (BRT) or Kent (KNT);
- a Pahlavi / Middle Persian node: MacKenzie (PHD) and Nyberg (NYB);
- a New Persian node: Horn (HRN), Hübschmann (HUB), Cheung (CHEUNG, for verbs), Borhan-e
  Qate' with Mo'in's footnotes (BQT), Mo'in (MON), and Aryanpur (ARY);
- a Sogdian node: Gharib (SOD); a Khotanese one: Bailey (ISS_alt_DKS);
- an Arabic node or a Persian/Arabic loan in either direction: Klein (KLN), Jeffery (FVQ),
  Addi Shir (AFM), Asbaghi (PLA), Fraenkel (AFA), Lokotsch (LKT); for French/Spanish
  Arabisms Pihan (PHN), Devic (DEV), Lammens (LAM), Dozy (DOZ);
- an English / Romance node: Klein (KLN), Skeat (SKT), Funk & Wagnalls (FSD), Webster (WEB);
  Anglo-Indian words: Hobson-Jobson (HJB), Whitworth (AID);
- a Turkic node: Vámbéry (TTS), Lokotsch (LKT).

Grep each file for the headword (several spellings; Latin transliteration for the Western
books, Persian script for BQT/MON/ARY, Pahlavi transliteration for PHD/NYB). A grep that
finds nothing is also a result ("silent"). Record everything in a `consulted` array on the
node (separate from `ref_check`, which is only for the references Nourai himself cites):

```json
"consulted": [
  {"src": "HRN", "where": "no. 3, p. 1", "stance": "contradicts", "note": "Horn separates āb 'Glanz' from āb 'water' and derives āftāb from the former"},
  {"src": "PHD", "where": "p. 5 s.v. ābād", "stance": "supports", "note": "'ābād [ʾpʾt] populous, thriving' — no water element"},
  {"src": "WLD", "where": "Bd. I p. 46", "stance": "silent", "note": "root ap- listed, no Persian compound"}
]
```

`stance` ∈ supports / contradicts / partial / silent. Quote the key phrase. Books consulted
via the web (vajehyab for Mo'in, AHD online) go here too, with the URL archived via
fetch_source.py and listed in `sources`. Every node must have at least two `consulted`
entries from different books whenever the matrix lists two or more books for its language.

## Transcription flags: say WHERE the error is (required)

For every node you mark `transcription_suspect`, look at the printed page itself — render it
with `pdftoppm -f <pdf page> -l <pdf page> -r 300 -png -singlefile /home/sfmqrb/git/rishe/EtymologicalDictionary-persian-english.pdf /tmp/pg<pdf page>`
(or open `site/pages/<pdf page>.jpg`) and Read the image — and add to the node:

```json
"error_in": "book",            // "book" = the printed book has the odd form (author's misprint); the extraction is faithful
                               // "extraction" = the book prints the correct form; the JSON misread it
                               // "unknown" = could not decide from the image
"book_prints": "borrāgō",      // what the printed page actually shows
"correct_form": "borrāgō"      // the form that should stand (per the sources)
```

Usually the extraction is faithful and the problem is in the book itself; say so plainly in
`derivation` too ("the book prints X; this is Nourai's misprint for Y"). Only when the JSON
differs from the page is it an extraction error (report those separately in your summary — the
owner fixes the data). Copy the page PNG you relied on to
`data/verification/sources/refs/ocr/BOOK/<pdf page>.png` so the check can be audited.

## Persian explanation (required): `derivation_fa` on every node, `note_fa` on every root

Write the derivation a second time IN PERSIAN, for a Persian reader — not a translation of the
English sentence. Think about how a Persian etymologist (حسن‌دوست، ابوالقاسمی، معین در حواشی
برهان قاطع) would explain it to an educated Persian reader:

- Use the established Persian terminology: هندواروپایی آغازین، ایرانی باستان، اوستایی، پارسی
  باستان، فارسی میانه (پهلوی)، پارتی، سغدی، فارسی نو/دری؛ وام‌واژه، وام‌گیری، دگرگونی آوایی،
  قلب (metathesis)، ابدال، همگونی، پیشوند، پسوند، ریشه، ستاک، تحول معنایی، معرّب، ریشه‌شناسی
  عامیانه (folk etymology)، هم‌ریشه (cognate)، دوگانه (doublet).
- Give the Persian word first in Persian script, then the older forms in Latin transliteration
  as Persian philology does (e.g. «آب» از فارسی میانهٔ āb / āp، از ایرانی باستان *āp-، هم‌ریشه با
  سنسکریت āp-). Persian-script forms for Arabic words; Greek/Latin words in Latin letters.
- Explain the sound changes in the way a Persian reader expects (e.g. «پ ایرانی باستان در میان
  دو واکه در فارسی میانه به ب نرم شده»؛ «ای کشیدهٔ فارسی میانه در فارسی نو به ی بدل شده»).
- Say clearly, in Persian, what the verdict means for the reader: ادعای نورایی درست است / با
  احتیاط پذیرفتنی است / پژوهش امروزی آن را رد می‌کند و به جای آن … می‌گوید / خطای چاپی کتاب /
  خطای خوانش اسکن.
- Keep it 2–5 sentences, formal but readable (نه ترجمهٔ لفظ‌به‌لفظ، نه ماشینی). Numbers in
  Persian digits are fine. Mention the key sources by their Persian-usable names (پوکورنی،
  بارتولومه، هرن، هوبشمان، مکنزی، نیبرگ، چونگ، معین، برهان قاطع، ویکی‌واژه).

Field names: `derivation_fa` (node) and `note_fa` (root entry). Both required.

## Process documentation (required)

The owner wants to be able to audit every step later. Therefore:

- **Every web page you rely on must be archived**: after you read a page (WebFetch or
  curl), run
  `python3 /home/sfmqrb/git/rishe/tools/fetch_source.py '<URL>' --note '<page N, root X, what you used it for>'`
  This stores the page as text under `data/verification/sources/web/` and indexes it. Only
  URLs that were archived this way may appear in a `sources` array. (Batch several calls in
  one Bash command to save time.)
- **Every lookup in a local reference text must be quoted**: in `ref_check[].note` and
  `consulted[].note` include the exact phrase(s) you found (with the grep pattern or page you
  used), so the finding can be re-run.
- Your full transcript (every tool call and result) is exported automatically by the
  coordinator; nothing else needed for that.

## Sources to use (in roughly this order)

- **Wiktionary** (en.wiktionary.org) — has the best coverage of Persian, Middle Persian,
  Avestan, Old Persian, Sogdian, Arabic etymologies, with citations (Cheung 2007, Hasandust,
  MacKenzie 1971, Bartholomae, Horn, Hübschmann, Nourai himself). Fetch the word's page AND
  the `Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/…` / `Reconstruction:Proto-Iranian/…` pages.
  Use URL-encoded Persian/Arabic script for those pages.
- **Etymonline** (etymonline.com/word/<word>) for English/French/Latin/Greek chains.
- **American Heritage Dictionary IE roots** (ahdictionary.com/word/indoeurop.html or
  ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=<root>) — Nourai's "AHD" citations refer to the 1975
  appendix; the online appendix is the updated edition of the same list (local: Watkins 1985).
- **Pokorny** — local OCR (POK_01/02/03, POK_full) or indo-european.info / starlingdb.org;
  Nourai's "POK:nnn" is a page number in Pokorny's IEW.
- **Klein**, **Horn**, **Hübschmann**, **MacKenzie**, **Bartholomae**, **Kent**, **Nyberg**,
  **Mann**, **Buck**, **Walde-Pokorny**, **Jeffery**, **Addi Shir**, **Asbaghi**, **Lokotsch**,
  **Gharib**, **Cheung**, **Aryanpur** … are all on disk (see SOURCE_MATRIX.md).
- **Encyclopaedia Iranica** (iranicaonline.org) for historical/cultural routes.
- **Nişanyan Sözlük** (nisanyansozluk.com) for Turkish; **Lisān al-ʿArab** / Wiktionary for Arabic.
- Use WebSearch when you don't know the right page; use WebFetch to read a page.

Do NOT fabricate sources. If a page did not load or didn't help, don't cite it.
If a chain is well known and uncontroversial (e.g. Latin → Old French → English), one good
source covering the chain is enough; spend your effort on the Iranian and Semitic links,
which are where errors are likelier.

## Output — write ONE file per page

Write `/home/sfmqrb/git/rishe/data/verification/page-<pdf>.json` (UTF-8, no BOM):

```json

  "pdf_page": 126,
  "book_page": 96,

      "nodes": [

          "id": 6,
          "lang": "Avestan",
          "words": "pairi-daeza",
          "verdict": "confirmed",
          "derivation": "Av. pairi-daēza- 'walled enclosure' = pairi 'around' (PIE *per-) + daēza- 'wall' …",

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- Include EVERY node of every non-redirect entry on the page (even empty-word pass-through
  nodes like `[Latin] refs=None |` — give them a one-line derivation and a verdict).
- `words` = the transliterations of the node joined by "; " (copy from the chart).
- `derivation` must be specific: forms, sound changes, dates/eras, texts or peoples,
  semantic shifts. 1–5 sentences. No hand-waving like "derived regularly".
- Keep `note` on the entry for root-level comments and for anything cross-cutting.
- If a node lists several words, cover each word; if they differ in verdict, use the worst
  verdict for the node and explain per word in `derivation`.
- Where the chart's own NOTE already records a dispute, evaluate it: say which side modern
  scholarship takes.
- Every node has `ref_check` (array, may contain a single `not_checked` item) AND `consulted`
  (array) AND `derivation_fa` (string); every entry has `note_fa`.
- Valid JSON only. Test it with `python3 -m json.tool` before finishing, then run
  `python3 /home/sfmqrb/git/rishe/tools/verify_check.py <pdf page>` — it must show 0 PROBLEM lines.
- When done, reply with a SHORT summary (≤ 15 lines): counts of verdicts per page, and a
  bullet per `disputed` / `transcription_suspect` item (root, word, one-line reason), plus
  any extraction errors (JSON differs from the printed page) the owner must fix.
  Do not paste the JSON back into your reply.
